# Etch-a-Sketch

Simple etch-a-sketch for the Odin Project.

After researching how css-grid works I managed to get a base grid working quite quickly.
Implementing the 'change square size'  button wasn't too bad aswell. Although I did struggle a bit with making sure the number is always in the correct format. The maths for changing the grid-template turned out to be rather easy.

Adding a simple hover effect also didn't take too long to figure out, but making the square incrementally darker when hovered on multiple times turned out to be a real challenge. I struggled with finding ways to store a unique 'darkness'  variable for every square until someone from the discord pointed me in the direction of data- attributes. This turned out to be a very good hint and after some research I managed to get it working. I feel like I learned quite a bit from this project. Way more than from the last excercise (Rock, paper, scissors), in which I struggles way less.
